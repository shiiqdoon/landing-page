          <div class="text">The Fountainhead is a novel by Ayn Rand, first published in 1943. It's a philosophical 
          and dramatic exploration of individualism versus collectivism, told through the life of Howard Roark, a

          <div class="text">Antigone is a classic Greek tragedy written by Sophocles around 441 BCE, and it's part
          of the Theban Plays trilogy (though it was written first in terms of composition). The play focuses on
           the moral and political conflict that arises when Antigone, the strong-willed daughter of Oedipus,
            defies the kingâ€™s orders in order to uphold divine law and family loyalty.</div>
